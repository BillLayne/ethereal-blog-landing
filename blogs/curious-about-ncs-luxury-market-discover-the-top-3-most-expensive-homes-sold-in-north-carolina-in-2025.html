                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">What type of insurance do luxury homes in NC need?</h3>
                <p class="text-muted-foreground">
                    Luxury homes often require specialized high-value home insurance policies, sometimes called "premier" or "custom" policies. These go beyond standard homeowners insurance, offering broader coverage limits for the structure and contents, extended replacement cost, higher liability limits, and specialized coverage for unique assets like art, jewelry, and luxury vehicles. Carriers like Chubb, AIG, and Cincinnati Insurance are often preferred for their comprehensive offerings in the **North Carolina luxury market**.

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">How does coastal proximity affect insurance premiums in Wilmington?</h3>
                <p class="text-muted-foreground">
                    Coastal properties in areas like Wilmington, especially those directly on the ocean or sound, face higher risks from hurricanes, wind, and flood. This often means separate policies for wind & hail (often through the NC Coastal Property Insurance Pool) and flood insurance (through NFIP or private carriers). Premiums are generally higher due to these increased risks, but comprehensive coverage is crucial to protect your investment in these prime **NC high-end properties**.

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Luxury homes often require specialized high-value home insurance policies, sometimes called 'premier' or 'custom' policies. These go beyond standard homeowners insurance, offering broader coverage limits for the structure and contents, extended replacement cost, higher liability limits, and specialized coverage for unique assets like art, jewelry, and luxury vehicles. Carriers like Chubb, AIG, and Cincinnati Insurance are often preferred for their comprehensive offerings in the North Carolina luxury market."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Coastal properties in areas like Wilmington, especially those directly on the ocean or sound, face higher risks from hurricanes, wind, and flood. This often means separate policies for wind & hail (often through the NC Coastal Property Insurance Pool) and flood insurance (through NFIP or private carriers). Premiums are generally higher due to these increased risks, but comprehensive coverage is crucial to protect your investment in these prime NC high-end properties."
